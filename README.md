The financial news data sentiment analysis project will explore within each chosen news article 
biases (positive, negative, neutral) towards the specified financial topic: cryptocurrency
Word cloud of the most common words used within cryptocurrency articles

To measure biases, techniques that will be used is:
Text mining, document classification, and Natural Language Processing.
Question to answer while figuring out the code: “how do I classify this article as positive, negative, or neutral based on keywords?”
Question to answer for overall results of biases: “which financial news outlet is more bias towards cryptocurrency, which ones are against cryptocurrency”
Possible additional question: “what is the overall sentiment towards cryptocurrency over time?”

To produce word cloud on financial news, techniques that will be used is:
Text mining, finding most frequent words in article within dictionary. (NOTE: I already did this within the PKM_keyword.ipynb, it will just need to be modified)
Question to answer while coding: how do I code a word cloud and how does the data have to be formatted to be able to do that?
Question to answer for overall results: “which words are most commonly used within financial news outlets? Are these positive or negative words?”
