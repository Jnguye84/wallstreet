insert - tv commercial - day

over jungle sound effects, the camera is low, moving
through brush from the pov of a stalking animal. as the
brush parts, revealing wall street and the new york stock
exchange, we hear the resonant voice of gene hackman.

gene hackman (v.o.)
the world of investing can be a
jungle.

we see a charging, snorting bull.

gene hackman (v.o.)
bulls.

we see a ferocious, growling bear.

gene hackman (v.o.)
bears. danger at every turn.

pretentious classical music kicks in.

gene hackman (v.o.)
that’s why we at stratton oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.

various shots -- a conservative young man reviews a stock
portfolio with a wealthy older couple; a smiling young
woman sits before a computer talking into a headset.

gene hackman (v.o.)
trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.

we see the stratton “team” - an ethnically diverse group
of actors with their handsome, grey-templed “chairman”.

gene hackman (v.o.)
stratton oakmont. stabilty.
integrity. pride.

we see a shot of the black glass stratton building, and:

int. stratton oakmont iii - bullpen - day (feb ‘95)

absolute bedlam. 300 drunken stockbrokers, most in their
early 20s, chant wildly as jordan belfort, handsome, 30,
stands beside a dwarf dressed in tights, cape & helmet.

jordan
twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

the “bullseye” is a large dollar sign in the middle of a
giant velcro “dartboard”.

jordan (cont’d)
watch and learn, people!

the brokers go apeshit as jordan grabs the dwarf by his
pants and collar. in the crowd, cash flies as side bets
are made. jordan winds up, aims for the “dartboard”.

jordan (cont’d)
one. two. throw!!

the brokers cheer, and as the screaming dwarf takes
flight, hurtling toward camera, we freeze frame:

jordan (v.o.) (cont’d)
my name is jordan belfort. no, not *
him, me. i’m a former member of *
the middle class raised by two

accountants in a tiny apartment in

bayside, queens.

a series of polaroids -- (1969) *3b

jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand,
his parents max and leah behind him; jordan, 13, stands
holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach;
jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an amway sales brochure.

jordan (v.o.)
the year i turned 26, i made 49

million dollars as the head of
my own brokerage firm--

ext. long island expressway - day (feb ‘95) 4
a cherry red ferrari testarossa zooms down the l.i.e.
jordan (v.o.)
--which really pissed me off
because it was three shy of a
million a week.
the ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.
jordan (v.o.)
hey, my ferrari was white, like
don johnson’s in miami vice.
we see the same ferrari, now in white, as it zooms away,
a blonde head bobbing up and down in jordan’s lap.
ext. long island’s north shore - day (feb ‘95) 5

a twin-engine bell jet helicopter descends over a huge
mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

jordan (v.o.)
see that humongous estate down
there? that’s my house.

int. jordan's estate - master bedroom - day (feb ‘95)

we see naomi, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream
in laperla lingerie.

jordan (v.o.)
my wife, naomi, the duchess of bay
ridge, brooklyn, a former model
and miller lite girl.

naomi licks her lips; she’s incredibly, painfully hot.

jordan (v.o.)
yeah, she was the one blowing me
in the ferrari, so put your dick
back in your pants.

over the following, we see a quick

series of shots

all taken from tv; a mansion from lifestyles of the rich
and famous; wealthy people applauding at a polo match;

a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; robert wagner and
stephanie powers toasting with champagne on hart to hart.

jordan (v.o.)
in addition to naomi and my two
perfect kids, i own a mansion,
private jet, six cars, three
horses, two vacation homes and
a 170 foot yacht.

int. hotel bedroom - night (feb ‘95)

sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, jordan fucks an hispanic
hooker from behind.

jordan (v.o.)
i also gamble like a degenerate,
drink like a fish, fuck hookers
maybe five times a week and have
three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.

he dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses
it to blow some into her asshole.

jordan (v.o.)
oh yeah, and i love drugs.

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 4.

jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he’s hearing
voices.

int. helicopter - night (feb ‘95)

jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a
rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
controls next to his frantic co-pilot, captain dave.

captain dave
pull up! jesus! we’re gonna
crash!!

jordan’s head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.

the helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
30 feet above a huge mansion. down below, through
jordan’s hazy, double visioned pov, we see a sparkling
pool, tennis court and waterfall.

jordan (v.o.)
check this out -- despite my
completely fucked-up state, i
could fly straight while still
seeing two of everything.

he closes one eye; his pov sharpens. putting pressure on
the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
driving range... then lurches and slams to the ground.

jordan
(to captain dave)
ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
buddy.

int. jordan's estate - front door - day (feb ‘95)

morning. sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, jordan
heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

jordan (v.o.)
yes, on a daily basis i take
enough drugs to sedate greater
long island.

ext. jordan’s estate - continuous (feb ‘95)

he pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

jordan
i take quaaludes for my back,
fifteen to twenty a day.

jordan (cont'd)
i use xanax to stay focused,
ambien to sleep, pot to mellow
out, cocaine to wake up and
morphine because it’s awesome.

ext. stratton oakmont iii - long island - day (feb ‘95) 12

the limo pulls up to the black glass office building.
jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

jordan
but of all the drugs under god’s
blue heaven, there’s one that’s my
absolute favorite.

int. stratton oakmont iii - jordan's office - day (feb ‘95) 13

gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. with
the din of the brokerage firm bleeding in, jordan uses
a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. as he
peels a crisp $100 dollar bill off a wad, rolls it up:

jordan
enough of this shit’1ll make you
invincible, able to conquer the
world and eviscerate your enemies.

he snarfs up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

jordan (cont'd)

i’m not talking about this. i’m
talking about this.

(jordan unfurls the

$100 with a snap)
money is the oxygen of capitalism
and i wanna breathe more than any
other human being alive.

he crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,
where it comes to rest with two dozen others. over his
back as we track him out of his office toward what sounds
like the roar of a mob--

jordan (v.o.)
money doesn’t just buy you a
better life -- better food, better
cars, better pussy -- it also
makes you a better person. you
can give generously to the church
of your choice or the political
party. you can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.

14 int. stratton oakmont iii - bullpen - day (feb ‘95) 14

arms akimbo, jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open
space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

jordan (v.o.)
but most of all, in any country in
the world, money can buy you love.
fuck the beatles.

his 300 brokers, mostly young men with their jackets off,
scream wildly. they worship him.

jordan (v.o.)
with that in mind, at the tender
age of 22, after marrying my
girlfriend teresa--

14a scenes 14a - 18 omitted 14a
19 ext. wall street - day (may ‘87) 19
an express bus pull up -- its sign reads “wall
street”....

jordan (v.o.)
--i headed to the only place that
befit my high-minded ambitions...

jordan emerges, kisses teresa goodbye, then joins a sea
of commuters heading to work.

jerry fogel (pre-lap)
you are lower than fucking pond
scum.

20 int. l.f. rothschild - bullpen - day (may ‘87) 20

computers, telephones everywhere. at their desks, 45
shirt-sleeved brokers read their wall st. journals,
readying for war. like an eager puppy, jordan follows
broker jerry fogel, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

jerry fogel
you got a problem with that?
(reads name tag)
jordan?

jordan
nope. no problem at all.

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 7.

jerry fogel
your job is ‘connector’, which
means you'll be dialing the phone
over 500 times a day, trying to
‘connect’ me with business owners.
and till you pass your series 7,
that’s all you’ll be doing. sit.

jordan takes a seat at the desk next to fogel’s.

jerry fogel (cont'd)
just so you know, last year i made
over 300k and the other guy you'll
be working for made a million.

jordan (v.o.)
a million dollars? i could only
imagine what a douchebag that guy
must be.

a manicured hand lands on jordan’s shoulder. it’s mark
hanna, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

mark hanna
jordan? mark hanna.
(re: fogel)
good, you've met jerry. one of
the smartest guys in the office.
who’s ever sucked a dog’s cock out
of loneliness.

fogel’s smile turns to a frown. he hands jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.

jerry fogel
smile and dial. and don’t pick
your fucking head up till one.

mark hanna
don’t mind jerry, his father raped
him as a child. besides, i'm
senior broker here, he's a
worthless piker. i heard you
pitched stock at your job
interview.

jordan
had to do something to stand out.

mark hanna
i fuckin’ love that! let’s grab
lunch later. windows good with
you?

jordan
great. yeah.

hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant
electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

mark hanna
let’s fuck!!

ring!!! absolute pandemonium at the bell signalling the
opening of the stock market. feet fly off desks; brokers
and their connectors dial phones like mad. the camera
pushes in on jordan, mesmerized as he takes in the roar.

broker #1
(to broker #2)
miniscribe's a fuckin’ steal!
thirty eight bucks a share!

mark hanna
(into headset)
your broker in west virginia?
what are you buying, a coal mine?
it's the 80s, the game is high-
tech.

broker #2
(to broker #3)
fuckface! i got 50,000 july 50s!

jordan (v.o.)
you want to know what money sounds
like? visit a trading floor on
wall street. fuck this, shit
that. cock, cunt, asshole. i
couldn’t believe how these guys
talked to each other--

fogel notices jordan sitting there frozen. he covers his
mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

jerry fogel
dial the cocksucking phone!

jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

jordan (v.o.)
i was hooked within seconds.

mark hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
“buy” ticket. he places the ticket into a glass cylinder
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

jordan (v.o.)
it was like mainlining adrenaline.

the tube is whooshed into the ceiling and we’re suddenly--

int. windows on the world - day (may ‘87)

close on a coke spoon whose contents disappear up a
nostril. pull back to reveal...

the lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the
city. at a corner table, a paranoid jordan looks around
as hanna does another bump of coke. none of the other
diners seem to notice or care.

mark hanna
(offering the spoon)
got enough for one more? tootski?

jordan
no. thanks though.

hanna slips the vial into his pocket as hector, the
tuxedoed maitre’d, approaches.

hector
mr. hanna, what can i bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

hanna surreptitiously palms hector a $100; jordan
notices.

mark hanna
here’s the game plan, hector.
bring us two absolut martinis
straight up. precisely seven and
a half minutes after you deliver
those you’1l bring two more, then
two more every five minutes until
one of us passes out.

hector
an excellent strategy, sir.

jordan
actually, i’m good with 7-up.

jordan might as well have farted at the table.

mark hanna
first day on wall street, hector.
give him time.
(hector offers menus)
no thanks, i’m not eating.

hector heads off.
jordan

you can get high during the day
and still function?

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 10.

mark hanna
high is the only way to do this
fucking job. guy who coined the
term “three-martini lunch” was a
woman. cocaine and hookers, my
friend, the keys to success.

jordan smiles, not sure if hanna is kidding.

jordan
i gotta say, i’m really excited
about being part of your team.
i wanna do all i can for our
clients and --

mark hanna

(reciting an ad)
“here at l.f. rothschild, our
clients aren’t just important,
they’re family.” just as long as
we get our taste first. remember
something, jordan, your top
priority in this job: make us
money. if the clients get rich
along the way, bully for them.
got a girlfriend?

jordan
wife. she cuts hair.

mark swallows a comment about that. gets to business.

mark hanna
ok, first rule of wall street.
nobody -- and i don’t care if
you're warren buffet or jimmy
buffet -- nobody knows if a
stock’s going up, down or fucking
sideways, least of all stock
brokers. but we have to pretend
we know. make sure you stay
relaxed. nobody wants to buy
something from someone who sounds
like they haven’t gotten laid ina
month. take breaks when you feel
stressed, jerk off if you can.
you like jerking off, right?

jordan
well... sure.

mark hanna
good, jerking off is key. and i
highly recommend cocaine, which
will make you dial faster, which
is good for me. churn ‘em and
burn ‘em, baby.

a busboy stops by with a fresh napkin for mark who thanks
him. then, discreetly as possible, mark removes a fresh
vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.

jordan realizes: that’s why he palmed the maitre d’ $100.

jordan (v.o.)
for the next six months i learned
the ways of wall street.

int. strip club - night (oct ‘87) 22

as strippers grind in b.g, jordan parties with mark hanna
and dozens of brokers and trainees. jordan sips a
martini and studies mark hanna, hitting on a stripper.

jordan (v.o.)

that fall i passed my series 7.
finally it was here.

int. rothschild building - lobby - day (oct ‘87) 23

briefcase in hand, jordan boards the elevator with a
dozen other brokers.

jordan (v.o.)
my first day as a stockbroker, a
future master of the universe.

and as the doors close, on screen we see:

october 19th, 1987

int. l.f. rothschild - bullpen - day (oct ‘87) 24

total chaos. jordan dials the phone as all around him
brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

jordan (v.o.)
they called it black monday.
by four p.m. the market was down
508 points, the biggest one-day
drop since the crash of ‘29.

4 p.m. the closing bell rings; the entire place goes
silent. brokers look at each other, stunned.

mark hanna
holy. fucking. shit.

and as the brokers start commiserating with each other...

jordan (v.o.)
l.f. rothschild, a company that
had been in business since 1883,
closed its doors within a month.

int. jordan & teresa’s apartment - kitchen - day (dec ‘87)

jordan sits at the table perusing the times classifieds.
teresa approaches with two coffees. sits next to him.

teresa
so i’ll take an extra shift, don’t
worry about it.

jordan
you work too much as it is.

teresa
we could pawn my engagement ring.

jordan
we’re not pawning anything. i’m
gonna be a millionaire, teresa.

teresa
you know that doesn’t matter,
right?

he smiles, kisses her. together, they peruse the ads.

jordan
(points to an ad)
“nobody beats the wiz”. i could
be a stock boy.
teresa
you're a stock broker.
jordan
no one’s hiring brokers right now,

sweetie.
they go back to the ads. after a few beats, she points--
teresa
this place is.
ext. strip mall - parking lot - long island - day (dec ‘87)

in a suit, jordan emerges from an ‘85 datsun. he looks
around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.

int. investor's center - day (dec ‘87)

the antithesis of l.f. rothschild, with cheap furniture
and a dozen misfit “brokers” giving loud, obnoxious sales
pitches. jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.
dwayne, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

jordan
i’m looking for investor’s center?

dwayne
that’s us, hey. dwayne.

jordan
(as they shake hands)
jordan belfort, i called earlier.
i was a broker with rothschild.

dwayne motions jordan to a seat. nearby, a broker in
ratty keds, toby welch, is screaming into his phone.

toby welch
i’m tellin’ you, this stock is
goin’ up!... cause i know,
okay?!... i have inside

information!
jordan looks at him, appalled at what he’s hearing.

jordan
where are your quotrons?

dwayne
no quotrons, we sell off the pink
sheets -- penny stocks.

dwayne slides jordan a large thin book; its pages are
literally pink. he explains as jordan flips the pages:

dwayne (cont’d)
company don’t have enough capital
to be listed on nasdaq, their
shares trade here.

(points to the book)

like these guys, aerotyne? they
make radar detectors out of a
garage in dubuque.

jordan
six cents a share? who buys this
crap?

dwayne

schmucks mostly. mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can
get rich quick. they answer our
ads, popular mechanics, hustler.

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 14.

jordan
the spread on these is huge.

dwayne
so’s your commission, that’s the
point. blue chips stocks you get
what, one percent? pink sheets

are fifty.

jordan
wait a second. you’re telling me
if i sell two thousand dollars
worth of stock, my commission is a
thousand bucks?

dwayne
technically, yeah, but not even
the biggest schmuck buys two
thousand dollars of this shit.

int. investor's center - (later that) day (dec ‘87)

as others brokers bark into phones, jordan sits, phone
cradled in his shoulder, making notes. a few beats, then:

jordan
(into phone)
mr. fleming, good morning, jordan
belfort with investor’s center in
new york city. you recently
responded to one of our ads...

a few of the other brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

jordan (cont'd)
the reason i’m calling is that
an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today.
typically our firm recommends no
more than five stocks per year:
this is one of them...

a few more brokers look over...

jordan (cont'd)
aerotyne international is a
cutting edge tech firm out of the
midwest, awaiting imminent patent
approval on a new generation of
radar equipment...

later. now all the brokers listen in rapt attention.

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 15.

jordan (cont’d)
-- so if aerotyne’s shares rise

to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go
much, much higher -- your profit

on a mere three thousand dollar
investment would be upwards of

fifty thousand... that’s right,
you could pay off your mortgage.

seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

jordan (cont'd)
four thousand dollars, will
that be check or money order?...
thank you, sir.

jordan hangs up, scrawls out a “buy” ticket.
jordan (v.o.) (cont’d)
just like that i made two grand.
the other guys looked at me like
i'd just discovered fire.

toby welch and the other cave-brokers stare at him.

toby welch
how’d you fuckin’ do that?

int. investor’s center - (another) day (feb ‘88)
jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

jordan
it’s a rock-solid company, sir,
it’s the next microsoft...
six thousand. terrific.

as jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...
jordan (v.o.) (cont'd)
though i knew i was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks i
was making a fortune.
and as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...
jordan (v.o.)
and as a wise man once told me,
my only responsibility was to
put meat on the table.

close on a 1988 jaguar, parked outside a diner...

int. kacandes diner - bayside - day (jun ‘88)

wearing a suit, jordan sits in a booth reading the wall
street journal as a waitress serves the food. donnie
azoff, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright
white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

donnie
that your jag in the lot?

jordan
yeah.

donnie

nice ride. donnie azoff.

jordan
jordan belfort.

donnie
i’ve seen it around. we live in
the same building. twelfth floor?
(jordan nods)
what do you do, bro?

jordan
stock broker.

donnie
kids furniture, me and my brother-
in-law. making any money?

jordan
seventy grand last month.

donnie
get the fuck out. you made
seventy grand in one month.

jordan
seventy two actually.

donnie studies him, isn’t sure if he’s full of shit.
donnie
tell you what. you show me a pay
stub with $72,000 on it, i’m
quitting my job right now and
coming to work with you.

donnie (cont'd) *
holy shit.

jordan watches as donnie crosses to a pay phone and
dials.

jordan (v.o.)
and he did quit his job, which
i thought was a little weird.
i mean i had just met this
fucking guy.

a few beats, then into phone:

donnie
yo paulie, it’s donnie... yeah,
listen, i quit.

jordan studies donnie as he continues his conversation...

jordan (v.o.)
there were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white
teeth and the fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses to
look more waspy. he also married
his first cousin --

scene 31 omitted 31

int. bar - day (jun ‘88) * 32
jordan sits in mid-conversation with donnie over beers.

donnie
no problem, if we have a kid who's
a retard, we’ll just leave it on
the steps of some institution.

and as they continue drinking...
jordan (v.o.)
he was also a closet drug fiend.
i’d known him less than a week

before he talked me into smoking
crack.

ext. back of bar - day (jun ‘88) * 33

jordan and donnie get high. donnie holds a flame under a
crack pipe.

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 18.

jordan (v.o.)
the weird thing was when he’d do
crack, his face would contort into
this bizarre, frozen mask like the
phantom of the opera.

donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his
facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.
after a few beats, he hands the pipe to jordan.

donnie
you now, take a hit!

jordan takes a deep hit and holds it. a beat, then:

jordan
omigod, i fuckin’ love you!!

jordan (v.o.)
i knew i had to make him my
partner.

int. investor's center - day (sep ‘88) 34
jordan looks on as donnie works the phone like a madman.

jordan (v.o.)
which turned out to be a great
move -— donnie was a fast learner
who transitioned into the penny
stock business quickly.

ext. stratton oakmont i - auto shop - day (sep ‘88) 35

jordan and donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop,
which has a “for lease” sign in the window.

jordan (v.o.)
so within months we started our
own firm out of an abandoned auto
body shop.

int. kacandes diner - day (oct ‘88) 36

jordan sits with chester ming, robbie feinberg, alden
kupferberg ("sea otter”) and brad, muscular and bald,

jordan (v.o.)
in addition to donnie, i also
recruited my friends sea otter, *

jordan (cont'd)
in military terms it’s like carpet-
bombing -- noisy, menacing and
only marginally effective. as
stratton brokers you will be laser-
guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
priority targets. you will
establish an initial relationship
with your clients selling only
blue chip stocks -- then and only
then will you attempt to sell the
pink sheets, where the real money
is. now the key to every sale is
this:

jordan writes the word “urgency” on the board.

jordan (cont'd)
no one buys stock unless he thinks
it’s going up and going up now.
you must convince your client to
buy before the takeover happens,
before the lawsuit is settled,
before the patent is granted.
if he says i'll think about it and
call you back, it’s over, you’re
dead! no one calls back! so you
have to create urgency --

int. stratton oakmont i - auto shop bullpen - day

client, the other brokers listening in.

jordan
--and once kodak settles the
lawsuit, institutions will be
permitted to buy their shares in
large blocks again. and when that
happens, which is any day now,
what do you think will happen to
the price of kodak stock?

client (0.s.)
it’ll go up?

jordan
exactly. which is why you should
pick up 5000 shares today, a
$200,000 investment.

somersaulting gymnasts and baton-twirlers bring up the

brokers, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow
talking into phones. some have pets, which they tend to
while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a
chimp. others are getting shoulder rubs by masseuses

or being fitted for suits by a tailor. over the above:

finally there were pink sheets,
skanks, the bottom of the barrel.

a “pink sheet” hooker, covered in tattoos, is on all
fours as sea otter rides her like a pony.

jordan (v.o.)
they usually cost a hundred or
less, and if you didn't wear a
condom, you'd get a penicillin
shot the next day and pray your
dick didn't fall off.

the above-mentioned “pink sheet” hooker sits on a stool,
as sea otter fucks her.

jordan (v.o.)
not that we didn’t fuck them, too.
believe me, we did.

jordan
give us a minute, will you, guys?

he closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly,
letting out a little moan.

max
what’s the matter?

jordan

nothing, just... my back’s been
killing me. pain shooting down my
leg. not to worry, it’1ll pass.

max
what do the doctors say?

jordan

i’m tellin’ ya, kid, one of these

jordan
in order to keep these guys
working, i gotta keep ‘em
spending. i need to keep them
chasing the dream. you flash some
cash, they do the same. it keeps
them motivated.

max
pissing away money? that’s what
motivates you kids?

jordan
i could afford to pay them more,
but then they wouldn't need me as
much. and as long as they need me
they'll always fear me. i know it
sounds crazy.

max
crazy? this... is obscene.

he turns and exits. jordan watches him go, thinking.

donnie gesticulates wildly. the guys crack up.

we push

in on donnie, practically drooling, as jordan gives us a

quick tutorial on ludes...
quaalude tutorial
cut to: extreme close up of guys doing drugs.

jordan (v.o.)
the quaalude was first synthesized
in 1951 by an indian doctor --
that’s dot indian, not feathers --
as a sedative, and was prescribed
to stressed housewives with sleep
disorders. pretty soon someone
figured out that if you resisted
the urge to sleep for fifteen
minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass
high from it. didn’t take long
for people to start abusing ludes,
‘course, and in 1982 the u.s.
government schedule one’d them,
along with the rest of the world.
which meant there was only a
finite amount of these things
left. no shit, you can’t even
find ‘em anymore today. you
people’re all shit outta luck.

sea otter
holy fuck.

jordan peers over the balcony where sea otter’s looking.

naomi lapaglia. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered
the party with her date blair. she smiles, full lips
parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short
dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

rugrat
my nutsack’s about to explode.

robbie
someone’s gotta take that down.

there’s no debate who that someone should be. eyes
locked on naomi, jordan makes his way downstairs.

with naomi taking in the party, her eyes flitting to
things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

naomi (v.o.)

a lotta people would look at me
and think: “golddigger, she’s out
to land the richest husband she
can.” but you see, i came from
nothing. like, below the poverty
line. and when you come from
nothing, being rich means never
having to go back to that.

jordan approaches cristy, 20s, one of his guests.

cristy
jordan, hey.
(he smiles; cristy
picks up his intent)
have you met my friend naomi?

jordan takes naomi’s hand, doesn’t let go.

jordan
naomi.

naomi

two hot-tubs, one off the master
suite overlooking the water. you
like to jet-ski?

naomi’s date blair offers his hand to break them apart.
toby welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

blair
hi. blair hollingsworth.

jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on naomi.

outside, hildy azoff chats with teresa. her eyes stray
to jordan chatting up naomi. teresa’s eyes follow hers
and sees them. ouch. hildy goes.

jordan
you’re telling me you've never jet-
ski’ed in your life?!

naomi
never.

blair
y'know, we really should hit it,
there’s two other parties we’re
s’posed to get to --

jordan
what? you just got here. stay.

naomi looks like she’d like to. hildy approaches,
introduces herself, then:

hildy
jordan, teresa needs your help.

jordan
with what?

hildy
i dunno, you’ll have to ask your
wife what she wants.

jordan sees: teresa is watching from afar.

donnie(o.s.)

with naomi wearing a blindfold, jordan leads her to the
end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

jordan

jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the
others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.

it was heaven on earth.

18 months later
splash! a glass of water hits him in the face.

naomi

soaking wet, jordan sits upright to see naomi standing
over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

jordan

naomi

naomi

who is she?! some little hooker

jordan
you’re an aspiring landscape

naomi

naomi winds up with the water glass. jordan stands tall,
puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

naomi (cont'd)
stop flexing your arms, you look
like a fucking imbecile.
(re: his crotch)
and don’t think that impresses me
much.

jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

jordan
i wasn't flexing my arms. you're
just lucky to have a husband who's

jordan looks at a visine bottle - “recommended dosage -

jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. on the fluffy
pink carpet is naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her
hips, manolo blahniks showing polished red toes. between
her legs sits skylar, their 5-month-old daughter.

jordan
hey, skylar.

naomi
(little girl voice)
good morning daddy. where’s my
kiss?

jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.

does daddy get to kiss both his
girls?

naomi
ohhh, no! daddy doesn't even get
to touch mommy for a very, very
long time.

naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she’s
wearing no panties. the wind goes out of jordan.

jordan
c’mon, nay, please. you know how
sorry i am. i swear i--

naomi

(cutting him off)
daddy shouldn’t waste his time.
and from now on it's going to be
nothing but short, short skirts
around the house! and mommy’s
so sick and tired of wearing
panties, uhhh. in fact she’s
decided to throw them all away.

(parting her thighs)
so take a good look. you’ll be
seeing an awful lot of it around
the house, but no touching.

she licks her lips seductively. jordan sets skylar
aside, starts grovelling.

naomi (cont'd)
what’s wrong, daddy?

naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking
it. jordan can barely speak.

jordan
c’mon, why are you doing this?
i said i’m sorry.

naomi

(pouting)
ohhhh poor, poor dada. he loves to
say how wrong he is when he’s
ready to come in his own pants.
isn’t that right dada? mommy loves
daddy so, so much and there’s
nothing she wants to do more right
now than to make love to daddy all
day long. well, i guess it’s time

lesson.

naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her
inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. jordan watches
transfixed, then a change comes over him...

jordan

i wouldn’t do that if i were you
mommy. i think mommy should hear a
story before she decides to please
herself like that.
can daddy tell mommy a story?

(off her nod)
and does mommy promise to keep her
legs spread wide, wide open the
whole time?

(she nods dreamily)
good. once upon a time there was
a great big mansion in long island
and the people who lived there had
lots and lots of money. but of
all the possessions they had,
there was one thing that was much
more valuable than all the rest
combined, and that was their
little baby daughter.

naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

jordan (cont'd)
now because he was very security-
conscious, the daddy hired two
full-time guards, big hairy men
both named rocco, and they
installed security cameras all
around the house. and one of
those cameras is right over
daddy's shoulder.

naomi’s eyes widen -- she look toward a teddy bear on a
shelf. we see that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

jordan (cont'd)

so smile, mommy! you're on candid

camera!

janet

is he wearing a bow tie?

in the bullpen we see a young stratton broker in a bowtie
cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming
goldfish. the broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

donnie (cont'd)
on new issue day?! on
cocksucking, motherfucking
new issue day?!

dozen of brokers and sales assistants look over as donnie
snatches up the fish. holding it by its tail, he jumps
up on the desk of the broker in a bowtie. now the entire
bullpen looks over.

donnie (cont'd)
this is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

with the flair of a showman, donnie pops the fish in his
mouth, swallowing it whole. the brokers cheer wildly.
donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the broker ina
bowtie:

donnie (cont'd)
now take your bowtie, get your
shit and get the fuck out!

bowtie is stunned. and as donnie storms off, we push in
on jordan, watching from across the room.

jordan finishes a phone call as donnie enters with steve
madden, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants
and t-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning
hair. jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

jordan

steve madden
hey buddy.

and as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

bustling with activity. with jordan and donnie looking

steve clears his throat, looks over at jordan -- he’s
terrified. jordan motions for him to calm down.

steve madden
i uh, i'd like to start by telling
you about my background in the
shoe industry.

another broker
nice fucking hat!

steve madden
i uh... first started working in
the shoe industry, in a shoe
store. when i was sixteen, my
friends were out chasing girls,
but i was learning about women's

shoes.
kalil peter deblasio
move the mike closer. we can’t fucking hear you!

he moves the mic; feedback screeches through the bullpen.

steve madden (cont'd)
sorry... anyway, my first job
was at a shoe store like i said
where i worked in the stockroom.
you know, i can honestly say i’ve
been a lover of women's shoes
since i was twelve--

broker #4
freak!

steve madden
no. heh-heh. not like that.
i mean somehow i became fascinated
with the endless design
possibilities for women's shoes--

broker #5 broker #6
queer! get a fucking life!

boos, hisses. steve looks at jordan, who motions for him
to speed up. he grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

steve madden (cont'd)
this shoe -- the mary lou -- is
the one that really put me on the
map. it’s a black patent leather
variation of the mary jane, but--

all right, let's hear it for steve

madden and the wonderful mary lou!

huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

jordan (cont'd)
okay, now that you got that out
of your system, i want you to know
why steve is so completely off the
fucking wall... it’s because this
man is a creative genius. steve's
power, his gift -- is that he
creates trends. artists like
steve come along once a century!
elvis! andy warhol! giorgio
armani! who knows how high this
stock could go? the 20s? the
50s? the 80s?

jordan motions for quiet.

jordan (cont'd)
i want everybody to look down.
see that little black box in front
of you? it's called a telephone.
now i'm gonna let you in ona
little secret about this

telephone --
that’s right
some action,

it won't dial itself!
-- until you take
it's nothing more
less hunk of plastic,

like a loaded m16 without a

and in the

case of the

telephone, it's the action of you,
a highly trained strattonite, a

killer who will not

answer!

take no for an

a person who will not

hang up the phone un

til his client

either buys or fucking dies!

mode of transportation on top of
it.

jordan finds the file he’s been looking for, offers it.

agent denham (cont'd)
(before he’ll accept)
what is this?

jordan

names and addresses of every guest
at my wedding. friends, clients. i
even threw in the seating chart.
heard that’s why you wanted the
video, figured this’d expedite
whatever it is you’re doing.

(denham looks: it’s

indeed a guest list

from the wedding)
i wanted to show you i’ve got
nothing to hide. i know you’re
investigating stratton but for the
life of me i can’t figure out why.
sure, my company is unorthodox;
what brokerage isn’t? maybe we’re
a little louder than most but we
don’t do anything illegal. talk to
the sec, they’11 tell you, they
checked us out up and down.

agent denham
the sec’s actually a civil
regulatory agency. we pursue
criminal activity.

jordan
that’s what i’m saying. you guys
take on real crime. which is why
i’m so curious: what do you think
we did?

the reason jordan asked him here, denham realizes.

agent denham
i can’t discuss ongoing
investigations.

jordan
i understand.

agent denham
though, to be frank, this case
kinda got dumped on my desk. some
higher-up felt your shop needed
looking into after all that press,
fell on me to do the looking.

jordan
you know who you should be looking
at? goldman, lehman brothers,
merrill.

jordan (cont'd)
what those guys’re up to with
collateralized debt obligations?
this internet stock bullshit?
c’mon. if you want, i’1l walk you
through exactly --

agent denham
-- that’d be great. and if there’s
anything you can give me just to
close out your file, get it off my

desk--

jordan
-- sure, get you back to the real
criminals --

agent denham
-- then we could both profit from
this little sit-down.

jordan sizes him up: what did denham mean by “profit”?

jordan

you sure you don’t want anything
to drink? water for your pal?

(denham demurs )
rumor is your started out in
finance. even got your broker’s
license before you joined the
bureau.

agent denham
who told you that?

jordan

(searches his memory)
jeez, who was it...?

(comes up short)
ever regret it? giving up the
money-crazed, pin-striped life?
ever think where you'd be if you’d
stuck with it?

agent denham
when i’m riding the subway home,
sweating my balls off, in a suit
i’ve worn three days, sure.

jordan
whattaya pull in working at the
bureau, if you don’t mind me
asking. 50-60k a year?

agent denham
just about. we get a free handgun
out of it, though, that doesn’t
suck.

jordan
s‘crazy, the world we live in, the
jobs with real value, the ones we
should appreciate -- firefighters,
teachers, fbi agents -- those are
the ones we pay the least.

agent denham
way of the world.

jordan

that’s one thing i like about what
i do, the opportunity to make that
right. take this kid we had
interning last year. didn’t want
to be a broker, wanted to be an
environmental scientist or
something, he had a student loan
debts up to his eyeballs. anyway,
his mom gets sick, all they can
afford is third-rate care. some of
us got together, made an
investment on his behalf and --
boom -- overnight everything
changes, she’s seeing the best
doctors in the country. sadly,
didn’t work out, she passed but
still: having the power to do that
makes all the other bullshit worth
while.

(as denham considers

that)
see, it’s all about proper
guidance, pat. knowing someone
with the right relationships,
who’s discreet. i can change a
life almost every day.

they measure each other.

agent denham
how much that intern make off your
deal?

jordan
north of half a million.

denham summons agent hughes over. to jordan:

agent denham

can you say that again, what you
told me?

(jordan declines with

a smile; to agent

hughes )
i believe mr. belfort just tried
to bribe a federal officer.

jordan
what? i was making conversation.

agent denham
sounds like that to me, jordan.

jordan
...no, no, no...

agent denham
...sounded like that...

jordan

...no, to constitute a bribe,
don’t i have to make an explicit
offer of money for services? with
an exact dollar figure attached?
all i said was “north” of half a
million. according to the u.s.
criminal code, that dog won’t
hunt, pat.

(then)
heard you were a straight arrow.
that you wouldn’t bend the rules
other agents might. he was right.

agent denham
you did a background check on me?

jordan
figured you were looking into me,
was only fair. plus you sail ona
yacht fit for a bond villain,
sometimes you gotta act the part.

agent denham
this is why you invited me down to
your yacht? with a couple hookers
on it --

jordan
-- those are friends --

agent denham
-- to get a sense of the guy who
was coming after you?

jordan puts his hands up: “you got me.”

jordan
thanks for coming down. now get
off my boat.

agent denham
you know, most of the wall street
jackasses i bust, they were born
to the life.

agent denham (cont'd)

their father was a douchebag
before them, and his father before
that. but you, you got this way
all on your own. good for you,
jordan.

(as he starts to go)
thank you for having us. i’m
absolutely certain we’ll see each
other again.

(before he does)
you know, this is about the nicest
boat i’ve ever been on. just think
what a hero i’1l be in the office
when the bureau seizes it.

jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can’t let
denham get the final word. he calls after them:

jordan
hey, denham! i’m gonna eat a claw
of lobster now as i get my cock
sucked by heidi down below. you
have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that!

as he watches them pull away, seething --

jordan (v.o.)
he was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
fucking-money’er. he wasn’t gonna
come at me through my guys,
looking for a weak link and a
quick kill. he was gonna come at
me like an accountant would, the
way ness got capone, through my
books. which meant? it was ass-—
covering time.

six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. jordan
looks over at donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

jordan

int. banque real de geneve - saurel’s office - day

jordan, rugrat and donnie drink coffee with saurel and
one other swiss banker. it’s an impressive office, with
an enormous fish tank.

donnie
we have a joke in america.
“heaven is a place where the
police are brits, the chefs are
italian, the car mechanics are
german, the prostitutes are french
and the bankers are swiss.” i
never got it ‘til now -- look at
those fucking fish! come here,
little guy...

saurel
yes, we have the same joke here.
only sometimes the english are
chauffeurs and the chefs are
french. the germans, alas, are
always mechanics; no one wants to
grant them more authority than
that.

polite laughter. jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
cuts straight to the point:

jordan
i'm curious about your bank
secrecy laws.

saurel
excusez-moi, jordan, swiss custom
requires ten minutes of idle chit-
chat before business can be
discussed.
(a smile)

of course, let’s get “down to it.”
what would you like to know?

jordan
under what circumstances would you
be obligated to cooperate with an
fbi or u.s. justice department
investigation?

saurel
ca depend.

jordan
ca depend? ca depend on what?

script provided for educational purposes. more scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/librarythe wolf of wall street buff revised pages 3/5/13 84.

saurel
whether america plans to invade
switzerland in the coming months.

rugrat
want me to see if tanks are
rolling down the rue de la croix?

more chuckles. through jordan’s forced smile:

jordan (v.o.)
what i’m asking, you swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over.

saurel (v.o.)
i understand perfectly, you
american shitheel.

saurel smiles.

saurel
the only way the banque real de
geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body is if the crime
being pursued also happened to be
a crime in switzerland. but there
are very few swiss laws pertaining
to your “rumored” improprieties.
which is why mr. azoff’s joke is
most appropriate: from a financial
standpoint you are now in heaven,
and we welcome you. if the u.s.
justice department or fbi or sec
or irs sent us a subpoena, it
would become papier-toillette. we
would wipe our ass with it.

everyone’s impressed. except jordan.

jordan
unless it was an investigation
into stock fraud -- which is a

crime in switzerland. then you'd
have to cooperate.

saurel
(now he’s impressed)
yes, we would. assuming the
account is under your name.
however, if it were in the name of
a nominee of yours...

they take each other in.

jordan (v.o.)
was that yodeling i just heard or
did you just say what i thought
you said?

saurel (v.o.)
yes! yes!

as the meeting wraps up with handshakes, jordan's v.o.
overwhelms saurel’s v.o..

jordan (v.o.)
he was telling me to use a
rathole. problem was: sneaking a
u.s. rathole into switzerland was
a chance i couldn’t take. what i
needed was somebody with a
european passport.

the cash.

aunt emma
moving the cash.
(smiles )
i feel like a character in an
ian fleming novel. it’s all quite
racy, isn’t it?

jordan
it is, and it’s illegal too. of
course if you ever got in trouble,
i'd come forward in two seconds,
say i duped you, but even still.

aunt emma
risk is what keeps us young, isn’t
it darling?

jordan
i like that attitude. promise me
you'll spend at least ten thousand
pounds per month out of the
account, okay?

aunt emma
(chuckles)
i wouldn't even know how. i
really do have everything i need.

jordan
but i bet you don't have
everything you want. how about a
bigger apartment so your grandkids
can sleep over?

aunt emma notices that jordan is sweating, fidgety. he’s
jonesing.

aunt emma
shall we sit?

jordan
sure, that’d be great.

they sit on a nearby bench. after a while:

aunt emma

well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex.

jordan
(chuckles; then)
why did i just tell you that?

aunt emma
(playful)
because i’m very easy to talk to.

jordan looks at her. a few beats, then:

jordan
as a matter of fact you are. my
job, you know, it’s tough. i mean
i’m not complaining, it’s just the
stress. all these people depending
on me. millions of dollars at
stake every day. i sometimes feel
i’ve bitten off more than i can
chew.

aunt emma
you’re a man with large appetites.

jordan looks at her and smiles:

jordan (v.o.)
is she fucking hitting on me?

jordan
i agree. i put it on myself. it’s
hard to control the anxiety, you
know? it’s hard to learn to relax.

aunt emma
to release the tension.

jordan (v.o.)

jord, do i have a surprise for
you. twenty real lemons! a retired
pharmacist friend of mine’s been
sitting on these the last 15
years.

jordan
you fucking serious?!

close on -- a lemmon 714 quaalude; pure white, with
trademark ridged edges.

jordan (v.o.) (cont'd)
the lemmon 714 was the holy grail
of quaaludes, outlawed since the
‘80s and three times as powerful
as anything available today. for
a quaalude addict, it was like
finding a 1952 chateau margaux.

close on -- donnie gauging jordan’s excitement, waiting
for the right moment to admit his fuck-up.

donnie(v.o.)
i'd been saving these for a
special occasion, like a birthday
or celebrating our money being out
of the country. instead i thought
i'd better use ‘em to help break
the news about brad.

jordan can’t respond. phone still to his ear, his
eyelids droop. drool spills from his slackened jaw.

jordan (v.o.)
after fifteen years in storage,
the lemmons had developed a
delayed fuse.

jordan's pov -- is hazy as he stares at his own
reflection in the pay phone.

jordan (v.o.)
it took 90 minutes for the little
fuckers to kick in, but once they
did -- pow! i had skipped the
tingle phase and went straight to
the drool phase.

jordan's pov -- the phone gets further and further away.

jordan (v.o.)
actually i’d discovered a new
phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

bammm!! jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out
on his back. from the dangling phone, we hear:

bo dietl (0.s.)

jordan! jordan! do not get behind
the wheel! just tell me where
you're at, i'll send rocco!

jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach
for it; he can’t. he lays there for a while, then:

jordan (v.o.)
c’mon, stand up!

he rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

jordan (v.o.)
okay, walking is off the list of
options. all right, what else is

slowly, jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top

forcing himself over the edge, jordan begins to descend
the steps, one at a time. thump. thump. then faster.
thump- thump-thump. faster still. he loses control,
takes all the steps at once. thump-thump-thump-thump-

drags himself up and into the lamborghini.

gagging sound. donnie holds his throat as he falls
backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous crash! naomi rushes back in.

naomi
omigod, he’s choking! jordan, do
something! !

just then, we hear the triumphant popeye fanfare --
jordan looks to the tv, where popeye pours a can of
spinach down his gullet. instantly, his chest and arm
muscles swell to five times their size.

jordan goes to get his coke. he snarfs up two fat
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

jordan rushes back to donnie, who is now blue.

naomi (cont'd)
he’s not breathing!

jordan places his fingers over donnie’s artery. nothing.

naomi (cont'd)
save him!

jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping donnie’s chest,
breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

jordan (v.o.)
this stupid sonovabitch! all
donnie ever did was fuck me up and
now i had to save his life ‘cause
i took a cpr class when the baby
was learning to swim. just for
the record, i want it noted: not
for a second did i even think
about letting him choke to death,
even though it would’ve saved me
an awful lot of headaches.

donnie still isn’t breathing. jordan flips him over,
tries the heimlich -- we hear a crunch as he breaks
donnie’s ribs. he flips him back over, but he’s almost
completely blue.

hard as he can into donnie’s lungs. donnie’s stomach
distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham
projects from his mouth and into jordan’s face. donnie
coughs, vomiting. and as he starts breathing again,
jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.

gravely shaking their heads.

jordan (cont'd)
and the fact that i'm gone won’t
stop me from giving donnie advice,
not that he needs any--

donnie

why would anyone in their right
mind not follow jb's advice?

donnie looks petrified; he’s used to being an offensive
tackle, not the quarterback.

jordan
before i go, there’s something i
want to remind you all, and that’s
this -- stratton oakmont is bigger
than any one person, even me.
especially me. you guys are
stratton, each and every one of
you, and that is why it’s sure to
remain the best brokerage firm in
the fucking world!

thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all
300 brokers on their feet. we push in on jordan.

jordan (cont'd)
see, the very idea of stratton is
that when you come here and step
into this bullpen for the first
time, you start your life anew.
you have a place here and no one
can take that away from you!
stratton oakmont is america! give
me your tired and poor! the very
moment you walk through that door
and pledge your loyalty to this
firm, you become part of a family,
you become a strattonite! it
doesn’t matter who you are, it
doesn’t matter where you’re from!

worship him. in the crowd he finds kimmie belzer, 30s.

jordan (cont’d)
everybody here knows kimmie
belzer, right?

hoots and hollers... he raises his hand for quiet.

jordan (cont'd)
in case any of you weren't aware
of it, kimmie was one of
stratton's first brokers, one of
the original twenty. now when
most of you met kimmie, you met
her the way she is today -- a
beautiful woman who drives a brand
new mercedes, a woman who lives in
the finest condo complex on long
island. a woman who wears $3000
armani suits, who spends her
winters in the bahamas and her
summers in the hamptons!

wild applause.

jordan (cont'd)
but that’s not the kimmie i met.
the kimmie i met was broke, a
single mom on the balls of her
ass. three months behind on her
rent with an eight year old son!
she came to me for a job and when
i hired her she asked for a $5000
dollar advance so she could pay
his tuition. and what did i do,
kimmie?

kimmie
you wrote me a check for $25,000!

jordan
because i believed in you, like
i believe in each and every one
of you!

kimmie
i love you, jordan!

as the brokers go berserk, jordan stands basking in the
adoration. he looks at donnie, turns back to the crowd,
looks out at the faces. a change has come over him.

he stands there, thinking. an eternity, then:

the nice thing about getting

then they make you dance.

glances out a porthole, where we see the distant lights
of a plane making its way across the night sky. after a

what’s the single most important

the infomercial.

shot on 90's-era video, an ad intended for late-night

commercial may be amateurish, jordan isn't; he's an
excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

we start with flashes of the seminar: jordan in front of
a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience.

jordan
at the essence of every personal
interaction, of every business
transaction, of every effective
human communication is
persuasion... once you learn to
control the linguistic encounter,
you will be shocked at what will
happen... you are a person worth
listening to, and taking it one
step higher than that, you are
someone who can help them achieve
their goals...

jordan on the grounds of his estate, addressing us.

jordan (cont'd)

do you dream of being financially
independent but struggle every
month just to pay your bills?
would you like to own a home like
this one someday but can barely
afford to pay your rent?

there's no secret to wealth
creation. no matter who you are,

often, only when circumstances
dictate. it’s called a “grenada.”
inspired by our government's
invasion in 1983 of the island
nation of only 90,000 people,
basically it stands for any case
we get which is pretty much unlose-
able. we could show up late and
drunk to court, fuck up left-right-

you never did anything wrong
